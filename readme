# OxyVolve: Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/james-r-barrett/oxysolve/blob/main/oxysolve.ipynb)]

**OxyVolve** is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the analysis of oxygen evolution data collected from **Hansatech oxygen electrodes**. 

It automates the tedious parts of data processing—segmentation and rate calculation—while giving users interactive control to fit **Michaelis-Menten kinetics** dynamically.

## Features

* **CSV Upload:** Seamlessly handles raw CSV outputs from Hansatech software.
* **Automatic Segmentation:** Identifies distinct measurement phases in your data.
* **Dynamic Fitting:** Interactive sliders allow you to adjust the fit window and instantly see how it affects the rate calculation.
* **Kinetics Modeling:** Automatically generates Michaelis-Menten curves ($V_{max}$ and $K_m$) based on the calculated rates.
* **Browser-Based:** Runs entirely in the cloud via Google Colab—no local installation required.

## How to Use

1.  **Click the "Open in Colab" badge** at the top of this README.
2.  **Run the Cells:** Click `Runtime` > `Run all` (or press `Ctrl+F9`).
3.  **Upload Data:** When prompted by the script, upload your raw `.csv` file from the electrode.
4.  **Interact:**
    * Use the **sliders** to define the window size (in seconds) for the linear rate calculation.
    * Select whether you are analyzing a **CO₂ response** or **Light response** curve via the dropdown menu.
5.  **Export:** The script will generate plots and calculated kinetic parameters for you to save.

## 📂 Input File Format

The script is designed to accept standard `.csv` files generated by Hansatech recording software. 

* **Format:** Comma Separated Values (`.csv`)
* **Required Columns:** Time (s), Oxygen (mV or µmol)
* *Note: The script automatically detects headers, but standard Hansatech formatting is best.*

## Built With

* **Python** (Data Processing)
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **SciPy** (Curve Fitting)
* **IPyWidgets** (Interactive UI)
* **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
