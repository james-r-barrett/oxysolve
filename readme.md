# OxySolve: Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/james-r-barrett/oxysolve/blob/main/oxysolve.ipynb)

**OxySolve** is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the analysis of oxygen evolution data collected from **Hansatech oxygen electrodes**.

It automates the tedious parts of data processing—segmentation and rate calculation—while giving users interactive control to fit **Michaelis-Menten kinetics**.

## Features

- **CSV Upload:** Seamlessly handles raw CSV outputs from Hansatech software.
- **Automatic Segmentation:** Identifies distinct measurement phases in your data.
- **Dynamic Fitting:** Interactive sliders allow you to adjust the fit window and instantly see how it affects the rate calculation.
- **Kinetics Modeling:** Automatically generates Michaelis-Menten curves ($V_{max}$ and $K_m$) based on the calculated rates.
- **Browser-Based:** Runs entirely in the cloud via Google Colab—no local installation required.

## How to Use

1. **Click the "Open in Colab" badge** at the top of this README.
2. **Run the Cells:**.
3. **Upload Data:** When prompted, upload your raw `.csv` file from the electrode.
4. **Interact:**
   - Use the **sliders** to define the window size (in seconds) for the linear rate calculation.
   - Select whether you are analyzing a **CO₂ response** or **Light response** curve using the dropdown.
5. **Export:** The script will generate plots and kinetic parameters for saving.

## Input File Format

Accepts standard `.csv` files generated by Hansatech software.

- **Format:** CSV (`.csv`)
- The script segments at the user event log points, and also uses the concentrations inputted at those points.
- *Note: Automatic header detection works with standard Hansatech formatting for CO2 response curves*

## Built With

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **SciPy**
- **IPyWidgets**
- **Matplotlib**
